	<h1>Welcome to Mr O'Shea's website!</h1>
	<div class="bodytext">
	<p>This is an example of the type of thing you're going to be building over the next few lessons.  There is a Rubric on Google Classroom with the features you'll need to implement.</p>
	<p>Here is a list of things to include:
	<ul>
	<li>At least 4 HTML pages that link together  in some fashion</li>
	<li>A CSS file setting the style of the pages (including font, colours, backgrounds, image size and layout)</li>
	<li>An application of Javascript: maybe a button that changes the content, or some navigation that responds to the user</li>
	<li>At least one image on a page</li>
	<li>Use of Heading tags/links to external pages</li>
	</p>
	</ul>
